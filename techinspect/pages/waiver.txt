1. I AM AWARE OF THE NATURE of the EVENT(S) and my experience and capabilities, and believe myself to be qualified to participate in the Event(s). I will inspect the premises, facilities, and equipment to be used, or with which I may come in contact, AND IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING IS UNSAFE, I WILL IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE RESTRICTED AREA AND REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE FURTHER IN THE EVENT(S).

2. I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT: (a) THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EVENT(S) ARE VERY DANGEROUS and participation in the Event(s) and/or entry into the Restricted Areas involve RISKS AND DANGERS OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY, INCLUDING PERMANENT DISABILITY, PARALYSIS, AND DEATH ("Risks"); (b) these Risks and dangers may be caused by my own actions or inactions, and the actions or inactions of others participating in the Event(s), the rules of the Event(s), and the condition and layout of the premises and equipment, or THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE "RELEASEES" NAMED BELOW; (c) there may be OTHER RISKS NOT KNOWN TO ME or that are not readily foreseeable at this time; (d) THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LOSSES and/or damages that could result from the Risks COULD BE SEVERE AND COULD PERMANENTLY CHANGE MY FUTURE.

3. I HEREBY ACCEPT AND ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS KNOWN AND UNKNOWN AND ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LOSSES, COSTS, AND/OR DAMAGES INCURRED FROM SUCH INJURY, DISABILITY, PARALYSIS, OR DEATH, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE "RELEASEES" NAMED BELOW.

4. I HEREBY RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE the promoters, participants, racing associations, sanctioning organizatons or any subdivison thereof, track operators, track owners, officials, car owners, drivers, pit crerws, rescue personnel, any persons in any Restricted Area, sponsors, advertisers, owners and lessees of PREMISES on which the Event is conducted, premises inspectors or Event inspectors, surveyors, underwriters, consultants, and other persons or entities who given recommendations, directions, instructions, or engage in risk evaluation or loss control activities regarding the premises or EVENT(S), and each of them, their officers, directors, agents, and employees, all for the purposes herein referred to as "RELEASEES", FROM ALL LIABILITY TO ME, my personal representatives, assigns, heirs, and next of kin FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LOSSES OR DAMAGES INCURRED FROM ANY INJURY, including, but not limited to, death or damage to property, CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE "RELEASEES" OR OTHERWISE.

5. If, despite this relase, I, or anyone on my behalf, makes a claim against any of the RELEASEES name above, I AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND SAVE AND HOLD HARMLESS the RELEASEES and each of them from any litigation expense, attorney fees, loss, liability, damage, or cost they may incur due to the claim made against any of the RELEASEES named above, whether the claim is based on the negligence of the RELEASEES or otherwise.

I HAVE READ THIS RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT, AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT BY SIGNING IT I GIVE UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS I WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR LOSSES OCCASIONED BY THE RELEASEES' NEGLIGENCE, AND SIGN IT VOLUNTARILY AND WITHOUT INDUCEMENT OF ANY NATURE AND INTEND FOR IT TO BE ENFORCED TO THE GREATED EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
